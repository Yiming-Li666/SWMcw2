!! (Fixed) Bugs found that when doing setting again, will not apply the lastest setting.
-- In drawBoard() method exists a lot of duplicate code, new method CreateCookie() that encapsulates the code can then call it.(WS04-S05)

* (X) Need to randomly create the maze.
* (Done) Need to seperate into different packages.
* (Done) Need to use image to represent pacman and ghost.
* (Done) Need to have difficulty setting with both ghost number and maze difficulty.

-- Bugs fixed that if pacman died near the re-alive point, move the nearest ghost to the starting point.

2019.11.27
* (Done) consider the speed.
-- Added different score rate for different difficulties.
-- Design pattern
-- -- Factory pattern
-- -- -- Use GhostFactory() to generate different ghosts by receiving the name of the ghost.
-- -- Singleton pattern
-- -- -- Use Pacman() to create a new object, while this class contains only one object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.
-- -- State Pattern
